## RPG

A generic 2D role playing game.   This is probably going to roll in a different direction, but I'll take it somewhere eventually.

Requires Python 2.6 or greater and PyGame installed.  Run start.py to begin.  It current moves too fast, but is functional.

Early Ultima-style tile based graphics, with line of sight fog of war.
